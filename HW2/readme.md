This was interesting. The AI easily did what I wanted it to do. However, it did not explain what it was doing very well. It gave me some ideas of how to make what I had made better, mostly in appearance, but if I wanted to know why or how it did something, I had to identify the line of code myself and then ask it specifically why it did that in order to get the explanation for what it was doing and why it did it.  For example, when it added the \n in the console.log ("\nMy favorite games:"), I had to ask it to explain why it had added that and only then did I get the explanation that: “This is a newline character. When the console prints the string, the \n creates a line break before the text "My favorite games:". This means the text will start on a new line in the console output. It makes the output in the console more visually organized and easier to read by separating different sections with a blank line.” As said by ChatGPT. I decided to implement that effect into my own draft as well, since it looked better than what I had at the time. If I just had made the AI make something and had not then incorporated its codes into what I had made, it would not have been helpful prospectively, since I would not have learned why it had added the \n or understood what use it would be. I would have been unable to explain the code very well, so I also could not claim it as fully my own as I could not understand it. So, one important thing is that before I implement a new piece of code from ChatGPT into my own coding, it is a good idea to ask it what specifically the codes does to get the full explanation and then decide if it is worth adding or helpful to add into what I have made.
