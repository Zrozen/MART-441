This was interesting and fun to work on. Producing new things to add was especially fun. The AI was useful for quickly implementing ideas into the game. It was also useful for simplifying things. It was not useful for testing the game or making any atheistic choices. Sutch as at level five the cards started to cover the reset button, so the grid layout needed to change. I decided to end the game at level 8 as it was easier to keep from being too messy and would still not cover the reset button. Also, as the game is timed on a countdown, I decided to not make it too hard. The AI would also sometimes suggest nonsensical ideas such as taking the idea that level 8 needed to have more time was to give it the same amount as level one. Another thing was that I had to decide if the timing was possible for a human, as the AI did not pay attention to that. The AI was extremely helpful with simplifying my coding when it was getting too spaghettified.  As I was not good enough to consistently beat level 8, I had to add a cheat to the win function to make sure the win screen looked right. Another thing was that the AI only did what I asked it to do, it has no creativity of its own, and while it can suggest things, it does not do well with thinking creatively or considering things to make the game mechanics better. It helped lower the number of cards, so they are staged but did not think about how all the cards must be in pairs, or the game is unwinnable, I had to fix that. Another example is clicking had to be disabled on game over or you could just keep going and at no point did the AI consider this. An annoying thing was keeping new elements that fade in then disappear from jarring the cards.
