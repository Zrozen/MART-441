This project was interesting and definitely a good way to get reaccustomed to working with web pages coding. It was annoying to get the parallax working, but it was worth it because it was a cool effect. I did use ChatGPT for a combination of troubleshooting and to help explain some of the coding that I was not getting and/or where the other explanations that I could find where not helpful or were not focused on the one specific element that I was not getting. The AI was definitely useful for troubleshooting but decidedly less-so for the alternate explanations I was seeking. The AI kept going off into all the many ways that one could accomplish the thing that I wanted to do, rather than just answering with the type of code I was currently working on. Another difficulty I encountered was deciding what I wanted to add to the website. Considerations included both which pictures of mine that I wanted to use, because they need to look decent and the words and responses that I wanted to use.
