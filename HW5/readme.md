This was interesting and fun to make. The AI was good at quickly making matching styles of images for the pictures needed for the cards. It was also helpful making the coding. It needed a lot of guidance to make the visuals look artistically good, and it was a lot easier and faster to just edit than doing the coding myself.  I just entered the requirements and reviewed what it did and decided what it did not do well.  I used a different coding style from the example, and it looked ... not great, especially as it programed the links to pull images but did not actually make any images.  Just taking that result and not actually working on the project at all myself would be obvious as there would be no pictures. The AI did suggest a cool effect of making a card grow and have a glowing outline when the cursor hovered over it, and it looked really cool.  I incorporated that moving forward. The example given by the teacher was useful as a starting point, since it showed the gist of what the program needed to do and look like. It was surprisingly fun to see what the AI could offer to make the game look cooler after the requirements for the game were met. It suggested adding a victory screen and confetti which sounded really cool. It continued to be really bad at the art and visual effects. Getting the confetti to look good took a while and the AI was not helpful for this part as it remains bad at art, beyond being guided to make images, coding art remains poor. The AI was helpful with making the exercise into an actual game. Instead of just flipping cards, it has a reset button and a victory condition with the “You win” and confetti. I did need to fix the positioning of the reset button and its coloring so it would not stand out so much and take the attention away from the cards. I ended up creating a back-up file of a version that met the assignment requirements more closely, so that my interest in exploring and extrapolating would not interfere with the assignment requirements.
