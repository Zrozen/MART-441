Classes are annoying to get set up but once they are working, they are helpful and pretty fast to use. Especially when adding its simple to just add another. Something different is that AI tends to have a default way of doing a style that feels very social media and is both not good looking and very simplistic. It was useful to get things set up but again I did need to know how it worked so that I could make the edits to how it looked so it looked good and to adjust them and add pictures into the array.
