I built this game off my previous project as it had the base set-up and just needed editing to meet the requirements. The AI was useful for quickly getting the substantial changes and set-up done but the small tweaks and artistic touches remained with me. The AI remains extremely helpful for bug decoding. It still needs to be led to being helpful and tends to make a list of what to check but it is helpful. The AI was extremely helpful in making collectible stars because that coding was complicated. The AI was again helpful in making the game much cooler. It was helpful for quickly implementing things I wanted to try adding, such as making things move or making the collectibles glow and rotate. It was extremely helpful in getting the spawns both to be random and to not overlap most of the time. Although I tried to fix it, I could not figure out what was causing the player character to ‘stick’ going a specific direction, usually after a reset.
