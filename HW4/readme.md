An important but annoying element is that the typed element is case sensitive. This was later fixed but was extremely annoying before then. The Chatbotâ€™s creation only made the first answer a typed in answer and in the next stage was back to the simpler button options. The Chatbot also did not have the required number for any type of decision. However, it was extremely helpful with generating coding scripts fast so I could try multiple ways and tweaks for the visuals quickly.  It was also helpful for figuring out the first time where I needed to put a code to make it work. Then I can work on it from there.  The Chatbot was also helpful with figuring out why the input box kept moving and how to fix it. The AI was also helpful for quick checking if I did all the requirements once the code got longer. However, at a certain point, it would not recognize that a missing part had been added and would just loop the same code, insisting it needed to be fixed when the changes were already present. The AI was also helpful for finding the coding needed to make the end-product look a lot cooler. When getting the input box in the right position and properly visible was annoying me, the AI was helpful for quickly checking for errors and finding possible fixes fast without my having to search for my specific problem somewhere on the forums and hope that the answer for fixing the issue had not been deleted. I ended up with a mix of real and AI pictures. One last thing was that the more complicated/longer my code got the worse the AI got at being helpful.
