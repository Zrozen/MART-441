This was a really fun project to work on and the tutorials were very helpful. The project was straight forward to do as it was just follow the steps and here is what it does. The AI was a helpful tool to implement more precision changes to the code. For example, I could easily figure out how to change the jump key to the space bar from the up arrow. The AI had the suggestion to also make it so the character could only jump once per key press. It was fun to make the hedgehogs the spikes. I did have to manually make the image smaller as that was easier then trying to make it smaller via code. There ended up being two stars that are really hard to get requiring a precise angle but I thougt it added a higher level of difficulty so I decided to leave it as is for now. The AI was helpful for making the game over screen and trouble shooting once more. It did have problems making the game over screen as the AI sugested a method that did not work for the version of phaser that is being used. I finally fuigerd out what the actual problem was when I remembered to check the console for errors, as that is generally more helpful for narrowing down the specific error.
