The example was a big help to see how everthing was put together. The AI was helpful for big changes and overhauling, but aesthetically the program actions were still on me. AI was also helpful for geting things set up quickly. Then I could decide what to prune and adjust to what I wanted. The AI was still very helpful with suggesting cool things to add and more advanced coding things that I could add. While I did need to ensure that the AI stuck to the fact that we are working with HTML5 and some other things, it was pritty good at staying on track. The AI seems to start getting off the borders I place if I ask for things that could be done easier with something else, which made me realize why it had previously kept going off-topic. Freesound.org was super helpful as ever for getting the sounds for the game.
