I was having a really hard time getting the shapes to appear and could not figure out why the style.css was not being applied. It finally occurred to me to check the console, which led to the problem being that I had added an ‘s’ to make it ‘styles’ instead of ‘style’ so that was fun to figure out. When corrected, it started working just fine. The AI was useful to getting the broad strokes of the coding started but was not helpful to figure out the added ‘s’ problem at all—like it did not even suggest that I check that or the console. AI remains really bad at making the final product look cool by itself and good at setting up the code. Even then, it does need to be checked and understood for me to make quick updates or trouble shoot. The AI was helpful in making the movement more interesting as it helped make the shape slide around. Getting the various things to not overlap was hard. It was interesting to figure out the different options of how to make overlap not a thing and how they get progressively more complicated as the probability that it will work goes up. I did manage to get something that seems to work most, if not all, of the time. The only instances of overlap I saw was that sometimes the sliding shape would cross an image or text, but it was not often, or sometimes the shape would cross as it spawned or faded. I did not see the image or text overlap at all in the testing time.
