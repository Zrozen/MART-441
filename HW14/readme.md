I had a hard time making the library work. I ended up having to download the teacher's example off github and then adjusted the path to match that one. Once that was done, it started working. I decided to make the 3d model through the AI to see what it could do. It was interesting, as what the AI produced was deeply ugly and, as expected, very aesthetically unappealing. AI remains really bad at making art by itself. My attempt at a cat (or dog) is not much better, but at least the shapes are actually touching each other. The AI was super helpful for troubleshooting coding errors but sometimes got stuck in loops and had to be led back out of them for actualy helpful advice. It was more helpful for making the star.
