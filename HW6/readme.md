One problem I ran into was getting the style to work right for the intro page. It took me awhile to realize the button was in the wrong location because I had moved the h2 brackets around it and that was overriding the button formatting. I had a really hard time figuring out why the data was not saved to the local host past the first page. The problem ended up being two separate problems. One problem was that the attempts counter was overriding the rest of the information.  The other problem was that Firefox was being weird.  I had to personally figure out the attempts counter-override problem and then tried AI to help with a solution. Working with the AI to figure out how to get the attempts counter to not override the rest of the information was both helpful and annoying as the AI had difficulty pinpointing the exact source of the problem. It repeatedly offered a variety of basically the same solution that did not get me anywhere, so it was much easier for me to figure out what the program was doing and then partially work with the AI but also do a lot of the coding myself.  The AI was completely useless for figuring out that half of the problem in the post-first page issue was Firefox.  I ended up contacting the teacher to ask about why the local host wasn't saving and his comment that ‘it should be working if it works on the live server version’ tipped me off that it might be Firefox being weird again, and it was.  AI remains helpful and programming in extra steps that just make the end result look cooler. It was also helpful at suggesting where I needed to put the ‘print to console’ debugging lines, and to figure out what my code was not doing correctly, but it still does not do the artistic flourishes very well. For example, I had to personally adjust the timing of the card flipping to make it a little bit more normal, so the player couldn't flip over multiple cards too quickly just because the animation took so long. And it was far simpler for me to just edit the coding than trying to get the AI to do it. I didn't even try to do that because I knew it wasn't worth it. It really seems that AI is good for doing the set-up and coming up with cool ideas to add, but not really anything fine-tuning or answering some of the more advanced questions. AI is really bad at doing any small quick tweaks. That is a good reason why I need to actually know how the codes work because then when I need to make these small fast tweaks that the AI is bad at, I can just do it.
