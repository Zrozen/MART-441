The project was interesting. It was complicated to understand at first but once I got it working for the first time, it was much easier to understand and to make changes. Not having to make the data set from scratch was nice, especially as I chose a Pokémon data set, so thanks for that. The AI was useful in making it simpler to set up the code and to add more interesting things to the page, e.g., the ability to search types. It is still terrible at the graphic design element beyond the basics. The AI is still also helpful for trouble shooting but more in suggesting for what to look for. Then I go look at the code myself going down the provided list of what might cause the error until I find it myself, which highlights that I did need to know the code myself. The AI was extremely helpful in making the coding for the search able to deal with multiple cases like "water" instead of "Water", and to react to either getting the button pressed or hitting enter, but it did not produce it by itself.  I had to think of it and prompt it with the idea.  It was helpful for adding fail safes into my code for if something triggers wrong. This was another project that was fun to keep adding things into especially as I was making a mini–Pokedex webpage.
