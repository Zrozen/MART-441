      <p> Video games are an interactive art form that people can relate and respond to in different ways. As games become more advanced and complex their relevance only increases.  Story-based games enable the player to explore and discuss a variety of topics and themes, using more senses, and more interactively than a book (some healthier than others). Video games can be used as an engaging learning tool. Some video games enable players to safely explore the outcomes of various interactive choices (like friendly, hostile, or neutral tone or meaning), although occasionally the offered choice is significantly different than implied by the summary text.  </p>
